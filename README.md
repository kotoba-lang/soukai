# soukai

総会 — a **shareholders'-general-meeting (株主総会) governance control plane**:
a secretary-LLM ⊣ ResolutionGovernor StateGraph that drafts convocation
notices, explains resolution outcomes, and drafts legal minutes, but never
sends a notice, records a resolution's outcome, or finalizes a minutes
record itself. The actor is **propose → draft only**: a draft commits as
data (a *casual commit* — phase-gated auto-approval is fine, it's just
proposed/explanatory content sitting there for review); actually **sending**
the convocation notice and **finalizing** the minutes are **always a human
call**, regardless of phase — and a resolution's recorded outcome is always
the verbatim output of a pure deterministic function, never the LLM's own
judgment.

Built on this workspace's
[`langgraph`](https://github.com/kotoba-lang/langgraph) StateGraph runtime —
the same pattern as [`koyomi`](../koyomi) (schedule-LLM ⊣ ComplianceGovernor),
[`kekkai`](../kekkai) (coord-LLM ⊣ TailnetGovernor), and
[`tayori`](../tayori) (reply-LLM ⊣ ComplianceGovernor). Here it is
**secretary-LLM ⊣ ResolutionGovernor**.

> Charter: **(G1)** propose → draft only, no direct actuation — the actor
> writes proposed/explanatory content, a human turns it into an outbound
> notice send or a legally-final minutes record; **(G2)** sending the
> convocation notice and finalizing the minutes are **always a human call**
> (high-stakes), independent of rollout phase; **(G3)** kotoba-native —
> meeting/snapshot/agenda/vote facts are durable EAVT ground facts, drafts
> are transient until committed; **(G4)** a resolution's :outcome is ALWAYS
> `soukai.tally/outcome-of`'s verbatim output — the secretary-LLM never
> invents a different possible/passed/failed judgment, and
> `soukai.governor`'s `resolution-mismatch` HARD check makes this
> structurally un-overridable, even by a human approval (a mismatched
> proposal never reaches `:request-approval` at all — it holds directly).

                                               常に人間)
```

**The actor never sends/finalizes/records anything the ResolutionGovernor
would reject, and secretary-LLM never actuates directly or rewrites the
tally.** HARD invariants force **hold** (a human cannot approve past a
proposal for a nonexistent meeting/agenda, a claimed-already-actuated
proposal, a notice sent short of 会社法299条1項's minimum, a missing
325条の3 electronic-provision URL, a resolution :outcome that disagrees with
`soukai.tally`'s deterministic math, incomplete 施行規則72条 minutes fields,
or a tenant mismatch); a clean send/finalize still routes to a human. A
close-margin resolution outcome (within 5 percentage points of the exact
approval threshold) is a SOFT escalate, not a hold — the math is never in
question, but a human should still take a look at a close real-world call.

## Run

```bash
clojure -M:dev:run     # drive: convocation → resolution → minutes through the actor
clojure -M:dev:test    # the propose-only contract + tally math + store parity + CACAO crypto
clojure -M:lint        # clj-kondo (errors fail)
```

Demo: register a meeting's ground facts (observe → facts) → draft a clean
convocation notice (phase 3 → clean → auto-commits, no interrupt) → send it
(**always** human sign-off, even though clean) → a second meeting whose
already-committed convocation draft has a too-late notice date (**HARD
HOLD**, un-overridable) → finalize an ordinary-resolution's outcome (clean
majority → `:approved`, `soukai.tally`'s verbatim output) → finalize a
special-resolution whose attendance falls under quorum (`:no-quorum` — a
CLEAN commit, proving the math is honestly reported, not a violation) →
finalize a special-resolution-2 (頭数+議決権 both measured against the total
shareholder universe) → draft then finalize the legal minutes (**always**
human sign-off) → prints the meeting-governance audit ledger → swaps to
`DatomicStore` with identical results.

## NoticeTarget → real backend (injection)

`soukai.noticeport` owns building the plain-text 招集通知 itself
(`notice-text`, from convocation draft content); `send!` hands that text to
an injected **Distributor** for actual delivery, same injection shape as
`koyomi.scheduleport`/`tayori.channel`. `mock-noticeport` is the runnable,
deterministic DEFAULT — it records what WOULD have gone out
(`{:meeting-id :text}`) into an atom and hands that same map to an injected
`distributor` fn (a no-op by default).

`soukai.distribute/resend-noticeport` is the opt-in REAL `NoticeTarget` — not
a `distributor` fn plugged into `mock-noticeport`, but a full drop-in
replacement swapped in via `soukai.operation/build`'s `:noticeport` opt. It
builds the Resend request via `kotoba-lang/mailer` (`mailer.core/request`,
same layering `koyomi.distribute` rides on), POSTs it with a real
`java.net.http` client, and records the returned Resend message id onto the
given `soukai.store/Store`'s append-only ledger (`{:t :sent-externally :op
:convocation/send :tool (str "resend:" id) ...}`, the soukai analog of
`koyomi.distribute`'s `:t :shared-externally` pattern). Unlike koyomi's ICS
invite (a separate calendar artifact attached to the email),
`soukai.noticeport/notice-text`'s already-built plain text IS the email body
directly — no attachment.

**Recipients are operator-supplied, not derived from the meeting.** Unlike
`koyomi.distribute`'s reuse of `:calendar/attendees` as the Resend `to`
list, soukai's own data model deliberately keeps `shareholder-id` (the
ground-fact identifier `soukai.store`'s snapshot/vote facts use) and email
address separate — there is no shareholder-id → email mapping anywhere in
`soukai.model`/`soukai.store`. Wiring a real company's shareholder registry
into this actor is a separate, bigger scope decision (a legally significant
record with its own accuracy/privacy obligations under 会社法), not
appropriate to bolt on silently as a byproduct of wiring up a mail sender.
So `resend-noticeport` takes an explicit `recipients` argument — a vector of
real shareholder email addresses the operator supplies at construction time:

```clojure
;; actor issues its own key, self-mints CACAO (same pattern as koyomi/kekkai/tayori)
(require '[soukai.kotoba :as k] '[soukai.cacao :as cacao] '[clojure.data.json :as json])
(def me    (cacao/load-or-create-identity! ".soukai/identity.edn"))
(def store (k/kotoba-store {:url "https://kotobase.net"
                            :json-write json/write-str
                            :json-read #(json/read-str % :key-fn keyword)
                            :identity me}))

;; a real secretary-LLM + the real Resend NoticeTarget
(require '[langchain.model :as model] '[soukai.operation :as op]
         '[soukai.secretaryllm :as secretaryllm] '[soukai.distribute :as distribute])
(op/build store
  {:advisor (secretaryllm/llm-advisor (model/anthropic-model {:api-key … :http-fn … :json-write … :json-read …}))
   :noticeport (distribute/resend-noticeport store ["shareholder-a@example.com" "shareholder-b@example.com"]
                                             "ops@mail.itonami.cloud")})
```

An unparseable/hallucinating LLM response falls to confidence 0 / noop, and
**ResolutionGovernor always hold/escalates** it (no path from a malformed
LLM response to an actual send, finalize, or recorded resolution outcome).

**Verification status: request-shape tested only, never live-called.**
`test/soukai/distribute_test.clj` proves the Resend request shape (URL,
headers, body, the notice text landing in `:text`, ledger recording, the
missing-`RESEND_API_KEY` failure path) against a stubbed `:http-fn` — zero
real network/credentials. Unlike `koyomi.distribute/resend-scheduleport`
(which a prior session live-verified with a real Resend send and a real
returned message id), **no live Resend call has ever been made against
`soukai.distribute`** — same "live未検証, mock既定" discipline
`soukai.noticeport`'s own R0 scope note applies to itself. `mock-noticeport`
remains the runnable, deterministic default; nothing in this repo makes a
live Resend call unless `resend-noticeport` is explicitly constructed and
wired in via `:noticeport`.

## cloud-itonami consumption

See `90-docs/adr/2607121700-kotoba-lang-soukai-agm-actor.md`. Add
`io.github.kotoba-lang/soukai {:local/root "../../kotoba-lang/soukai"}` to
`deps.edn` for in-process use. Wiring soukai into `cloud-itonami`'s own
projection/approval layer (as `holdco`/isic-8291 do for their own domains)
is tracked as a separate follow-up, out of scope here (mirrors koyomi's own
"cloud-itonami consumption" section — pilot wiring is deliberately deferred).

## Status

Scaffold + runnable. Store is `:db-api` driven — `MemStore ≡
DatomicStore(langchain.db) ≡ kotoba-store(kotobase.net)` on the same
contract. CACAO self-issuance is offline-verified. `soukai.tally`'s
quorum/threshold math is exact-rational (no floating-point division) and
covered at every documented boundary (exactly-at, one-unit-below) for all
three resolution types. `soukai.distribute/resend-noticeport` (the real
email `NoticeTarget`) is **request-shape tested only** (injected fake
`:http-fn`) — **no live Resend call has been made against this
implementation**, unlike `koyomi.distribute/resend-scheduleport`, which a
prior session live-verified with a real send; see 'NoticeTarget → real
backend (injection)' above for the honest verification status. `mock-
noticeport` remains the runnable, deterministic default.
