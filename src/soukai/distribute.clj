(ns soukai.distribute
  "REAL Resend-based Distributor for `soukai.noticeport`'s `:convocation/send` —
  the soukai analog of `koyomi.distribute`. `soukai.noticeport/mock-
  noticeport` stays the runnable, offline DEFAULT; `resend-noticeport` here
  is an opt-in real `NoticeTarget`, swapped in only via `soukai.operation/
  build`'s `:noticeport` opt — never the default, same discipline as
  `koyomi.distribute/resend-scheduleport` and `koyomi.kotoba/kotoba-store`
  (a real backend that's still a constructor call away, not an always-on
  side effect).

  Only this namespace touches the network (`java.net.http`) or
  `RESEND_API_KEY` — `soukai.noticeport` (notice-text building), `mail.*`,
  and `mailer.*` all stay pure, mirroring `koyomi.distribute`'s own charter
  verbatim (\"Only this namespace touches the network ... mail.* and
  mailer.* stay pure\"). `jvm-http-fn` below is a byte-for-byte port of
  `koyomi.distribute/jvm-http-fn` (same `{:url :method :headers :body} ->
  {:status :body}` convention) so `send-notice!` can be tested with a
  stubbed `:http-fn` instead of a real Resend call.

  `kotoba-lang/mailer`'s `request` builds the Resend envelope (from/to/
  subject/text/html + auth capability) — this ns does NOT reimplement that.
  Unlike `koyomi.distribute` (which attaches a separately-built ICS string
  as a `text/calendar` attachment, since a calendar invite is a distinct
  artifact from the share notification), soukai has no separate
  calendar-invite artifact: `soukai.noticeport/notice-text`'s already-built
  plain-text 招集通知 IS the email body directly, so no `:attachments`
  field is added onto `mailer.core/request`'s envelope at all.

  Recipients-are-operator-supplied (the one real design decision here, see
  `resend-noticeport`'s docstring): soukai's data model deliberately keeps
  `shareholder-id` (the ground-fact identifier `soukai.store`'s snapshot/
  vote facts use) and email address separate — there is no
  shareholder-id → email mapping anywhere in `soukai.model`/`soukai.store`
  (verified — grepping `email` across `src/soukai/*.cljc` is a zero hit).
  Wiring a real company's shareholder registry (which, unlike koyomi's ICS
  attendees, is a legally significant record subject to its own accuracy/
  privacy obligations under 会社法) into this actor is a separate, bigger
  scope decision, not appropriate to bolt on silently as a byproduct of
  wiring up a mail sender — so unlike `koyomi.distribute/share-message`'s
  reuse of `:calendar/attendees` as the Resend `to` list, this ns's
  `notice-message` takes an explicit `recipients` argument the operator
  supplies at `resend-noticeport` construction time, never derived from the
  meeting/snapshot/votes."
