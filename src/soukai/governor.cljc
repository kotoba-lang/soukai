  "ResolutionGovernor — the independent censor that earns secretary-LLM the
  right to *propose* a draft. The LLM has no notion of the notice-period
  minimums, the electronic-provision requirement, the record-date-scoped
  tenant boundary, or the no-actuation charter, so this MUST be a separate
  system (rules over the store's ground facts + soukai.tally's deterministic
  math) able to *reject* a proposal and fall back to HOLD — the soukai
  analog of koyomi's ComplianceGovernor / kekkai's TailnetGovernor / tayori's
  ComplianceGovernor.

  The actor is **propose → draft only**. It never sends the convocation
  notice or finalizes the minutes itself; both ALWAYS route to a human (the
  soukai analog of koyomi's always-human `:event/share`). Below, HARD
  invariants force HOLD (a human cannot approve past a proposal for a
  nonexistent meeting/agenda, a claimed-already-actuated proposal, a notice
  sent short of the statutory minimum, a missing electronic-provision URL, a
  resolution outcome that doesn't match the deterministic tally, incomplete
  legal minutes, or a tenant mismatch); a clean send/finalize still routes
  to a human (high-stakes, unconditionally).

  HARD invariants (ADR-2607121700 §4):
    1. subject-exists       — the meeting (or, for :resolution/finalize, the
                              agenda's meeting) the request concerns must
                              actually be registered. Unconditional —
                              independent of/prior to every other check, so
                              a nonexistent meeting/agenda can never
                              silently no-op its way past tenant-isolation
                              (mirrors koyomi's missing-activity-violations).
    2. no-actuation         — proposal :effect must be :draft, ALWAYS, for
                              EVERY assess op (not just the drafting ones —
                              soukai diverges from koyomi here: a
                              :convocation/send or :minutes/finalize
                              proposal that claims :effect other than
                              :draft is itself a hard violation, since
                              actually sending/finalizing is soukai.
                              operation's commit-time effect, never
                              something the advisor may claim to have
                              already done).
    3. notice-period-gate   — :convocation/send ONLY. The committed
                              convocation draft's :notice-date must be at
                              least the meeting's :notice-scenario's
                              required lead time (soukai.facts/notice-
                              period-catalog, 会社法第299条1項) before its
                              :meeting-date.
    4. electronic-provision-gate — :convocation/send ONLY. If the meeting's
                              :electronic-provision? is true, the committed
                              convocation draft's content must carry a
                              non-blank :electronic-provision-url (会社法
                              第325条の3).
    5. resolution-mismatch  — :resolution/finalize ONLY. The proposal's
                              :outcome is recomputed INDEPENDENTLY here via
                              soukai.tally/outcome-of (never trusting the
                              proposal's own :content :tally-summary) — a
                              mismatch is hard and un-overridable. This is
                              the single load-bearing invariant of the whole
                              actor: secretary-LLM never rewrites the tally.
    6. minutes-legal-fields-gate — :minutes/finalize ONLY. Every key in
                              soukai.facts/minutes-required-fields's
                              :fields set must be present and non-blank in
                              the committed minutes draft's content
                              (会社法施行規則第72条).
    7. tenant-isolation     — every assess op. The relevant content's
                              :tenant must equal the meeting's registered
                              :tenant.
    (any other op) — an unrecognized :op is itself a hard violation
                     (fail-closed: a not-yet-wired op must never silently
                     pass as clean).
  SOFT:
    Confidence floor → escalate.
    Close-margin heuristic (:resolution/finalize, :ordinary-resolution /
      :special-resolution only) — if the deterministic for/(for+against)
      ratio is within `margin-band` of the exact approval threshold,
      escalate even though the tally is mathematically unambiguous. This is
      a PRUDENCE heuristic (mirrors koyomi's double-booking soft-escalate
      framing: 'a human should still take a look'), never a hard violation
      — the math is never in question, only whether a human should
      double-check a close real-world call before it's recorded as final.
    AOI-clamped heuristic (`aoi-clamped?`, :convocation/send /
      :resolution/finalize only) — if the meeting's/agenda's registered
      定款 override was outside soukai.facts's legal bounds and got
      silently clamped back to the statutory figure at read-time, escalate
      so a human learns their registered AOI override didn't take effect
      — never a hard violation (the ingest-time registration already
      happened and can't be un-recorded; the CLAMPED, statutory figure is
      still what the HARD gates enforce either way, see
      notice-period-gate/resolution-mismatch above).
    `:convocation/send` and `:minutes/finalize` are ALWAYS high-stakes →
      human, at every phase (koyomi's `:event/share` charter, applied to
      both of soukai's two actuation ops)."
