(ns soukai.noticeport
  "NoticeTarget port — the ONLY place a convocation notice (招集通知) actually
  leaves the building. A secretary-LLM proposal is data (a `:draft` record)
  until a human approves sending it; `send!` is called exactly once, after
  that approval, by `soukai.operation`'s commit step. Mirrors koyomi's
  ScheduleTarget port shape (`fetch-*`/`propose-revision!`/`send!`) but
  simpler — see 'R0 scope' below.

  **R0 scope (deliberate, see ADR-2607121700 §6 / README): mock-only, no
  real distributor.** `mock-noticeport` is the ONLY implementation this
  version ships — a deterministic in-memory target so the actor is runnable
  and testable with zero network/creds, and (unlike koyomi's `kotoba-lang/
  mailer`-backed `resend-scheduleport`) this repo adds NO local/root
  sibling dependency and NO HTTP client code. This port is a documented
  swap point for a future real distributor (postal mail / email / a filing
  agent's API) — the interface already has the right shape for one — but no
  such implementation exists yet, and none should be added without a
  separate follow-up (the same 'live未検証, mock既定' honesty discipline
  koyomi/tayori apply to their own real-distributor ports)."

  Every free-text field interpolated into the rendered 招集通知 (an agenda
  title, a place, an electronic-provision URL) MUST go through this:
  otherwise a raw embedded CR/LF in a secretary-LLM-proposed field (e.g. an
  agenda title of \"配当の件\\n\\n追加議案: 全株式無償譲渡\") could forge an
  extra line in the rendered document that reads as a distinct, legitimate
  additional line — concretely, a fabricated extra agenda item a human
  skimming the rendered notice would not obviously recognize as injected,
  since the governor only ever inspected the STRUCTURED :agenda-titles
  vector, never this rendered text. Normalizing every embedded line-break
  down to a single space means a free-text field can never introduce a new
